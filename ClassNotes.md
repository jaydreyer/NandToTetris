## Week 1

### Unit 1.1: Boolean Logic

(x AND y)

x^y

x | Y | AND
--|---|----
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1

(x OR y)
x v y

x | Y | OR
--|---|----
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 1

NOT(x)

x|NOT|
--|--|
0|1
1|0

Formula and truth table = all possible values and results

Boolean Identities:
* Commutative Laws (x AND y) = (y AND x)
* Associative Laws (x AND (y AND z)) = ((x AND y) AND z)
* Distributive Laws (x AND (y OR z)) = (x AND y) OR (x AND z)
* De Morgan Laws NOT(x AND y) = NOT(x) OR NOT(y)

### Unit 1.2: Boolean Synthesis
Start with Truth Table, and then work backwards to get the function

**Theorem** Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression
containing AND, OR and NOT operations.

Actually, you can get by with just AND and NOT.

NAND

x|y|NAND
---|---|---|
0|0|1
0|1|1
1|0|1
1|1|0

(x NAND y) = NOT(x AND y)

**Theorem** Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing only NAND operations

1. NOT(x) = (x NAND x)
2. (x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)

### Unit 1.3: Logic Gates
A technique for implementing Boolean functions using logic Gates
* Elementary (Nand, And, Or, Not, ...)
* Composite (Mux, Adder, ...)

Nand: Two inputs and a single output
Functional spec: If (a==1 and b==1) then out =0 else out=1

Interface = what, Implementation = how
Circuit Implementation

### Unit 1.4: Hardware Description Language (HDL)
* HDL is a functional/declarative language - not procedural
* Order of statements doesn't matter, but usually you describe diagram from left to right.
* Generally use a, b and out.
* VHDL and Verilog are popular HDLs

### Unit 1.6: Multi-bit Buses
Sometimes bits are manipulated together as an array
We call these  groups of bits a "bus"

## Week 2
### Unit 2.2: Binary Addition
Binary addition is pretty straight-forward. Add the 1's and 0's. If there are two 1's to add, it's 0, and carry the 1, which makes sense because 10 = 2. If you carried the 1 and now you are adding 3 1's, it's 1 and you carry the one, which again makes sense because 1+1+1=3=11 in binary.

The farthest left digit indicates positive (0) or negative (1). This is how you do subtraction.

#### Building an Adder
Half-Adder = Adds two bits
Full-Adder = Adds three bits
Adder = Adds two numbers

##### Half-Adder
Simple, I guess. Adding gives you a "sum" and a "carry".
* 1+1, sum=0 and carry=1
* 1+0, sum=1 and carry=0
* 0+0, sum=0 and carry=0
Table!

| a | b | sum | carry |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
|1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

So, two inputs, a and b are inputs to the half adder, and two outputs, sum and carry come out.

##### Full-Adder
Full-Adder is for adding 3 bits. This would happen when you have to deal with a "carry" from a previous operation.

| a | b | c |sum | carry |
|---|---|---|---| -- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

So, three inputs, a, b, and c and two outputs: sum and carry.

##### Multi-bit Adder
Connect 15 full-adders with one half-adder. Or just do 16 full-adders.

So, a multi-adder takes a 16 bit a and 16 bit b, adds them, and returns a 16 bit out.

### Unit 2.3: Negative numbers
Could use farthest left digit to indicate pos/neg, but this is not popular and causes confusion. You get +/- 0, which is a problem.

Instead, use **2's complement**:
Positive numbers in the range: $0...2^n-1-1$ and negative numbers in the range: -1...-2^n-1

This confuses the hell out of me.

To convert a number to negative:
Convert -8 to 2's complement:
Convert 8 to decimal:
1000
Invert the digits:
0111
Add one:
1000

Convert 4 to 2's complement:
4 = 0100
Invert:
1011
Add one:
1100

Convert 6:
0110
Invert:
1001
Add 1:
1010

### Unit 2.4: Arithmetic Logic Unit
Half-Adder: Sum=XOR, Carry=AND

Full-Adder: Can be built from 2 half-adders

16-bit Adder:
* n-bit adder chip can be made from n full-adder chips
* The carry bit is piped from right to left
* The MSB carry bit is ignored

16-bit incrementor
* The single bit 0 and 1 values are represented in HDL as false and true

ALU - Holy shit.
* Building blocks: Add16, and various chips built in project 1
* Can be built with less than 20 lines of HDL code

## Week 3
### Chapter 3 - Sequential Logic
The chips we made earlier were combinational. They compute functions based solely on combinations of their input values. They don't maintain state, however.

The implementation of memory chips involves synchronization, clocking and feedback loops. Most of this is embedded in low-level sequential gate called a **flip-flop**.

**Clock** - Delivers continuous train of alternating signals: 0-1 or low-high, or tick-tock. Time between a tick and a tock is called a *cycle*. Each cycle = one discrete time unit.

**Flip-Flops** - We will use a DFF (Data flip-flop). Interface consists of single-bit data input and single-bit data output. Also a single-bit clock input that constantly changes based on the **clock**. out(t) = in(t-1). In and out are the gate's input and output values and t is the current clock cycle. DFF outputs the input value from the previous time unit.

**Registers** - Stores a value over time. To do this, need a mux. Set the load bit=1 to load new data, otherwise keep loading what is already there.

**Memories** - Stack together registers to form memory banks of arbitrary length. Stack many to form RAM. RAM accepts three inputs: a data input, an address input, and a load bit. The design parameters of RAM are *width* - the width of each one of the words, and its *size* - the number of words in the RAM. Modern computers use 32 or 64 bit wide RAMs whose sizes are up to hundreds of millions.

**Counters** - Sequential chip whose state is an integer number that increments every time unit. out(t) = out(t-1) + c, c usually = 1.

Three possible settings:
1. Reset: Fetch the first instruction
2. Next: Fetch the next instruction
3. Goto: Fetch instruction n

**Time Matters** - Sequential chips embed one or more DFF gates sandwiched between optional combinational logic layers.

> All we have to do is ensure, when we build the computerâ€™s clock, that the length of the clock cycle will be slightly longer that the time it takes a bit to travel the longest distance from one chip in the architecture to another. This way, we are guaranteed that by the time the sequential chip updates its state (at the beginning of the next clock cycle), the inputs that it receives from the ALU will be valid. This, in a nutshell, is the trick that synchronizes a set of stand-alone hardware components into a well-coordinated system

**RAM Unit**
RAM is a sequence of *n* addressable registers, with addresses 0 to n-1

At any given point of time, only *one* register in the RAM is selected

k = width of the address input. $k=log2n$

**Implementation Tips**
- RAM device can be built by grouping smaller RAM parts together
- The RAM's address input is two fields:
  - One field selects the RAM parts
  - The other field can be used to select a register within that RAM part.
- Use mux/demux to effect addressing scheme

PC (Program Counter)
- Set to 0
- Set to n
- Start counting
- Stop counting
- Can be built from a register, an incrementor, and some logic gates

## Week 4 - Machine Language
A *machine language* is designed to manipulate a *memory* using a *processor* and a set of *registers*

**Memory** continuous array of cells of fixed width (words or locations) each having a unique address

**Processor** Performs fixed set of elementary operations - arithmetic, logic, memory access, and control (branching) operations. Work in binary with registers and memory.

**Registers** Most processors have registers that serve as high speed local memory and hold a single value. Registers are faster than memory access

Symbolic notation = Assembly language. So...
* Use a text program to parse symbolic commands in mnemonics and operands
* Translate each field into the equivalent binary
* Assemble codes into binary machine instructions

The program that translates from assembly to binary is called an *assembler*

All machine languages support the following generic commands:
* **Arithmetic and Logic Operations** Addition, subtraction and basic boolean operations like bit-wise negation, shifting, etc. Commands start on left: ADD R2,R1,R3 would add the registers 1 and 3 and put value into R2.
* ** Memory Access** Usually 3 modes:
  * *Direct Addressing* LOAD R1,67 // R1 <- Memory[67]
  * *Immediate Addressing* Used to load constants. Instead of using address, load the numeric value itself: LOADI R1,67 // R1 <- 67
  * *Indirect Addressing*  GAHHH! The dreaded "pointers"!
*  ** Flow of Control ** Repetition (loops), conditional (if-then), and subroutine calling. Feature called "jump"
  * Unconditional jump = specify only the address of the target location
  * Conditional jump = also has to specify a boolean condition

### Hack Machine Language Spec
Hack is a Von Neumann platform. 16-bit machine with a CPU, two separate memory modules (1 instruction memory and 1 data memory), and 2 memory mapped I/O devices: a screen and a keyboard.

** Memory **
Instruction memory and data memory. The instruction memory is loaded like a ROM chip. You load it from a text file

** Registers **
2 16 bit registers called D and A
D is used solely to store data values
A can store data and addresses

** A Instruction **
@value
value can either be an actual value, or a name: @5 or @i
  * Provides only way to enter a constant into the computer
  * Sets the stage for subsequent C instruction designed to manipulate a certain data memory location, by first setting A to the address of that location
  * Sets the stage for a subsequent C instruction that specifies a jump, by first loading the address of the jump destination to the A register  

Hack syntax requires two commands for every operation involving a memory location

** C Instruction **
dest=comp;jump
Either the dest or jump fields may be empty
If dest is empty, the "=" is omitted
If jump is empty, the ";" is omitted

**comp** tells the ALU what to compute on the D, A, and M registers. 7 bits can potentially code 128 different functions. We just use 28.

**dest** tells where to store the computed value from ALU

**jump** tells which command to fetch and execute next. The default is the next statement.

  * JGT = out > 0
  * JEQ = out = 0
  * JGE = out >= 0
  * JLT = out < 0
  * JNE = out != 0
  * JLE = out <= 0
  * JMP = Jump

Workhorse of the Hack platform that answers 3 questions:
  * What to compute
  * Where to store the computed value
  * What do do next

** Symbols **
Three ways:
  * *Predefined Symbols* A special subset of RAM addresses using the following 3 predefined symbols:
    * *Virtual Registers* R0 to R15 refer to RAM addresses 0 to 15
    * *Predefined pointers* SP, LCL, ARG, THIS and THAT refer to RAM addresses 0 to 4.
    * *I/O Pointers* SCREEN and KBD are base addresses of screen and keyboard memory maps
  * *Label symbols* User-defined symbols for labeling destinations of goto commands (Xxx). Can only define once and can be called anywhere
  * *Variable symbols* User-defined symbol Xxx appearing in a program that is not defined elsewhere using the (Xxx) command is a variable and assigned a unique memory address starting at RAM address 16

** Input / Output **

Screen: black and white. 256 rows of 512 pixels per row.
1 row = 32 "words" of 16 pixels each (32*16=512)
To set the top left pixel to black:
@SCREEN
M=1

Keyboard: When a key is pressed, the ascii code appears in KBD. When no key is pressed, the code 0 appears in KDB

File Formats

Binary code files are stored in text files ending in .hack

Assembly language files are store it text files ending in .asm

** Pointers **
Variables that store memory addresses like arr and i are called pointers. You need something like A=M.
"Set the address register to the contents of some memory register"

**Mult**
Program performing R2 = R0 * R1
Multiply first two registers of memory and put result in R2
Use a loop to add up the multiples since there is no multiplication

**Fill**
Touch any key on keyboard, and the screen blackens completely. Let go and it's white.
